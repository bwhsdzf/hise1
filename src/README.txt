At the beginning of the project what we did was to read through the specification ,i.e. the requirements. We then analysed what we should do, and decided the procedures and functions we should have in the ICD package. When we started to work we chose to do pair programming, but we found that a bit slow as we had to find a time we both are free to work together. Then we set up a github repository so that we can split and work simultaneously, by this way we can also review each other's code.
For the project, our understanding is that the ClosedLoop is only responsible for combining and initialising all components of the system, and the whole system should be controled by the ICD unit, so we included basically all the required functions in the ICD package. For the debug, we simply used the Put procedure to put all debug message.
